## Inflation {.smaller}

. . .

- Inflation rates are currently very high
- At levels never seen by European Central Bank, since its creation in 1998

## Inflation {.smaller}

- There were even higher levels in the 70s (and 50s in France)

## Redistributive Effects of Inflation (1)

Inflation has *redistributive* effects:

- nonhomogeneity in consumption:
    - different household consume a different consumption basket
    - not all goods are affected in the same way
    - some households loose purchasing power today

## Redistributive Effects of Inflation (3)

### between savers and borrowers

## Redistributive Effects of Inflation (2)

### between agents in the economy

[A little Tweet](https://twitter.com/ojblanchard1/status/1608967176232525824)

- workers vs capital vs consumers


## Excessive Inflation

The redistribution caused by inflation introduces distortions in many.

Higher inflation is even more volatile and distorts markets even more:

- it makes the calculation of relative prices more hazardous

. . . 

__Hyperinflation__ is an extreme version

- defined by Cagan as inflation>50% per month
- follows extreme shocks/conditions
- usually associated with big government deficits


# Where does inflation comes from?

## The main sources of inflation

- demand-pull shock
- cost-push shock
- imported inflation
- expectations

## Cost-push shock

::: columns

:::: column

![Cost-push shock](assets/cost_push_shock.png){width=100%}

::::

:::: column

In the New-Keynesian fashion, we plot inflation against output

- A cost-push shock moves the supply curve to the left
- In equilibrium inflation increases

Which shocks affect the supply curve? (Econ 101)

::: {.incremental}
- productivity shocks
- changes in the labour market
- increased costs of materials
- uncertainty 
- ...
:::

These shocks affect both the long run and the short run supply curve

::::

:::

## Demand-pull shock

::: columns

:::: column

![Cost-push shock](assets/demand_pull_shock.png){width=100%}

::::

:::: column


- A demand-pull shock moves the demand curve to the right
- In the short term, production and inflation increase
- Then as prices adjust:
    - production decreases and inflation increases further

Which shocks affect the demand curve? (Econ 101)

::: {.incremental}
- productivity shocks
- changes in the labour market
- increased costs of materials
- uncertainty 
- ...

## Two recent shocks: covid

::: {.r-stack}

![Supply-Demand Decomposition (March)](assets/covid_shock_demand.png){.fragment}
![Supply-Demand Decomposition (April)](assets/covid_shock_demand_april.png){.fragment}

:::


Covid was a (negative) supply and (negative) demand shock.

- The effect of both shocks compensated each other so that effect on inflation was mitigated

## After Covid

::: columns

:::: column

[TODO: add postapocalyptic movie]

[graph with gdp recovering]
[graph with inflation]

::::

:::: column

After covid

- economy had seeminginly recovered without damage (V-shaped recovery)

- but demand recovered quickly
    - high savings during Covid
    - effect of government stimulus

- disorganization of the supply chain
    - reorganization

- two positive demand shocks

## And then the war in Ukraine...

![Prices of Oil (left) and Gas (right)](assets/gas_oil_price.png)

- A poster case of imported inflation
    - the price of (russian)oil-intensive goods rises more

## ... added to a persistent disorganization of world supply-chains

[TODO]

##

Inflation sous-jacente (hors énergie et alimentation) : +4,2 % en France, +5,2 % en zone euro

# What comes next

## What do we need to watch?

Demand-driven inflation seems out of question
- as long as the CB continues its policy rates

Cost-push shocks might be persistent
- oil prices will not revert
- cost of energy might increase further because of the green transition

What about the expectations channel?
