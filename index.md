## How do you define "Economics" ?

<div .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" --> 

__Wikipedia__: Economics is a social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services.

</div>

<div .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" --> 

__American Economic Association__: It can be defined in different ways. It’s the study of scarcity, the study of how people use resources and respond to incentives, or the study of decision-making. It often involves topics like wealth and finance, but it’s not all about money.

</div>

<div .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" --> 

__Definitions (Redux)__: people's decisions and interactions

</div>
