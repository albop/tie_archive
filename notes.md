## History

Quote from Von Neuman:

"You insist that there is something a machine cannot do. If you will tell me *precisely* what it is that a machine cannot do, then I can always make a machine which will do just that!"

Nick Bostrom: "once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore"

History

52-56: Arthur Samuel, checkers playing program
1956:  Dartmouth College summer AI conference. Mc Carthy coins the term "Artificial Intelligence"
1959: MIT AI Lab

Winter of AI: pessimism in AI community, in the press, cut in fundings
- Episode 1: 
  - 1966: disappointing results of "Machine Translation"
  - 1969: abandonment of connectionism (Rosenblatt, ...)
- Episode 2:
  - 1974: lighthill report, funding cuts (DARPA disappointed by ineffectivity of speech recognition)
- Episoe 3
  - late 80s, early 90s
  - colapse of LISP and expert system

State 2000s: AI had bad reputation
    - voice recognition, robotics, 
    - but: lots of technologies have 

Current Spring (since 2010):
    - language translation, image recognition, AlphaZero, AlphaChess, Watson

Why these trends ?
    - hype
    - long term research, subject to budget cuts
    - how to organize research on AI ? interdesciplinary research
    - premature ideas

### Two papers on automation

__Pascual Restrepo: Artificial Intelligence, Automation and Work __

task-based framework
    - measure displacement effect
    - productivity effect: increase demand for labour in non-automated task
    - force against it: creation of new "labour-intensive tasks"

### What Can Machines Learn and What Does It Mean for Occupations and the Economy?

Paper 1: Erik Brynjolfsson, Tom Mitchell, and Daniel Rock

- technology available today: Machine learning
- is it susceptible to replace workers ? is your work at risk ?
- only feasibility

- an occupation is a bundle of tasks

- Which are SML: susceptible to machine learning

- from O*NET database: 
- 964 occupations
  - 18,156 tasks
    - 2,069 work activities


- Crowdflower: evaluate work activities by answering
  - 23 distinct statements to be evaluated on a 5-point scale varying from “strongly
disagree” to “strongly agree.”

- automation is limited to codifiable activities
    Polanyi's paradox: we know more than we can tell

### Result (1)

Low SML occupations SML High SML occupations SML
Massage therapists 2.78 Concierges 3.9
Animal scientists 3.09 Mechanical drafters 3.9
Archeologists 3.11 Morticians, undertakers,
and funeral directors
3.89
Public address system
and other announcers
3.13 Credit authorizers 3.78
Plasterers and stucco
masons
3.14 Brokerage clerks 3

### Result (2)

 SML score versus occupational log
median wage percentile

[TODO: graph]

### Other approaches




ML learns by observing ad replicating

Singularity


Comparative advantage of labour and capital
