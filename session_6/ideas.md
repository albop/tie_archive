Cap and trade vs carbon tax

countries implementing carbon taxes:
- ARgentina
- Canada
- UK
- EU
- Sweden
- Japan

trading gives companies higher incentives to cut emissions

cap and trade: which companies must pay?
- government distributes allowances across industries

It worked for sulfur dioxide pollution : acid rains

2017: China: nationa carbon market

Reaching such a target for a global good (the climate) with minimal distortions would a priori require imposing a common price for carbon worldwide. There are many reasons why this may not be feasible. In particular, rich countries have accumulated a stock of emissions over the past centuries and should support a stronger effort, while poor countries need to catch up in terms of income in order to reach the technical
level they need to efficiently cap their missions. 



carbon leakage: 
- the direct leakage problem
  - sectors under constraint displace their production in regions where the constraint is less binding
- indirect leakage problem is related to energy markets
  -  by reducing their demand in fossil energy, regulating countries depress its price, which leads indirectly to higher emissions by nonconstrained countries

Current policies:
- energy intensive manufacturing: ETS system
- free allowances to high-emitting industries
- member states:
  - carbon taxation systems for services and non-tradable goods (housing, transport)
- no measure at the border

# CEPII briefing

First best : worldwide carbon price

Carbon Border Adjustment: 
- carbon pricing of imports + carbon border adjustment
- tariff
- consumption-based carbon taxation
- uniform tariff on countries not imposing (equivalent) policies to solve free-riding problem

# ZEN

Global Carbon Budget

## the climate clock

$\Delta T$    ~ $\Delta S$ (stock of GHG)

## Options (1)

identity of Kaya

- population growth
- economic growth
- energy intensity
- carbon content of energy

## economic growth

decrease or change behaviour ?

## decarbonisation of energy

fact : fossil fuels are not rare

problem: some stay underground
    - coal and oil

stranded assets

exploration / investment continues
- why ? (lack of credibility)
- myopia / free riding

## gas

less polluting
technological lock-in

## renewable

now cost- efficient

problem: not controllable

## negative emissions:

reforestation
bioenergy

geoengineering



## Climate policy

Pigou 1921: Carbon tax is efficient

price to a good that would be overconsumed

carbon tax has weaknesses:
- not enough for green R&D
- - behavioural bias
- netweork externatlities
- ..

other instruments
...

## Carbon tax very impopular. Why

it is regressive

compensate for regressive effects

target transfers

NB: standards and regulations just as regressive


## Climate policy

new risks

- Paris agreement

## Types of risk

transition risk: 
    from stranded assets


# Macro policy: damage avoided


# France: government preparing +4%


# Nordhaus


Climate Change as a Global Public Good

- nonrival
- non-excludable

the theory of public good was developped by Samuelson
public bad

successful international agreements:
- trade disputes (WTO)
- onzone-killing chlorofluorocarbons (Montreal protocol)

national issue:
- global interest instead of personal interest
international issues:
- individual nations enjoy only a small fraction of the benefits of their actions

## Integrated-assessment model

- nordhaus 75-77: energy/climate model
- nordhaus 83: static with damage
- nordhaus 90:
- Nordhaus 92-94-2016: Dynamic Integrrated model of Climate and the Economy
- cv evolution in Nordhaus  2018a

variants: RICE, PRICE, R&DICE (innovation), C-DICE (coalition)

structure of DICE: circular flow

![DICE Circular Flow](assets/dice_circular_flow.jpg)

## Mathematical Optimization

$$\max_{c_t} W = \max _{c_t} \int_0^{\infty} U[c(t)] e^{-\rho t} dt$$
s.t.
$$c(t) = M(y(t), z(t); α, ε(t))$$

Most complicated part: modelisation of the contraints.

Currently: about 20 equations to model the constraints.

Earth science:
- burning of fossil fuel ->  Carbon Dioxyde -
- GHG accumulate in the atomosphere
- warms land and oceans
- feedback effects

At the same pace: concentration in 20110 will includece +3/5 degrees in 2100.

Higher than any past temperature




## Solutions to slow dowsn climate change

A. abatement, i.e. reduce emissions of CO2, by reducing use of carbon fuels
B. carbon removal: remove CO2 from emissions or from the atmosphere
C. geoengineering (solar radiation-management: change reflectivity of the earth)

C. make earth more reflective. little mirrors. ex: add sulfate aerosols in the stratosphere
    - no effect on ocean carbonization
    - uneven effects
    - complicated international cooperation
    - salvage therapy
B. not feasible for now
A. abatement
    - average across several studies (cf Gillingham et al.)
      - cost for 50% emissions (0.5->3)
      - cost for 100% emissions (2->6)
    - assume different policies, and participation rates

Is the cost measure realistic ?

## Damages

damages to different sectors:
    - managed
    - unmanaged
(provide examples: high income, low income)

tipping points: -> sudden/irreversible damage
    - makes systems effectively unmanageable

impacts: nonlinear and cumulative
early studies:  1 or 2 degrees innocuous
mor erecent ones: (ex 2018 IPCC report on 1.5) even 2 degrees highly disruptive

DICE: damages are market and non-market
- 2% at 3 degrees of permanent consumption
- 8% at 6
Howard and Sterner: even more *3.5 times higher

damages:
- include catastrophic events
- do not allow for fat tails (contentious)

Criticism: it monetizes all activities
- can you value lost island, house damaged by hurricane
- traditional answer: we need a metric

Keynes: better to be vaguely right than precisely wrong



## IAM: main finding

social cost of carbon

the shadow price of optimization
what would be the benefit of relaxing the constraint by a little amount ?

## objective

setting up a target:

cost of attaining the target?

cost-benefit analysis

## major findings

- slow emissions as soon as possible
- uniformity of prices
  - equalize marginal cost of reducing emissions everywhere
  - carbon price should be equal everywhere
- high participation
- policy ramp up over time

Disagreement is about the *kind* of policy


## findings

DICE: 135 infeasible
cost-benefit: 3 degrees in 2100

## Carbon-pricing

must raise price of CO2

two options:
- cap maximum emissions and trade
- levy tax on carbon

consequences: 
signal for conusmers, producers, investors + information

## The social Cost of carbon:

- rising over time


## Issues of discounting

Ramsey-problem

## National to International

## Free-riding

free-riding and double free-riding

The concept of global warning was created by and for the Chinese, in order to make U.s. manufacturing non competitive.


## CLimate agreements

1994: United Nations Frameowrk Convention on Climate Change

The ulitmate objective is to achieve stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interferences with the climate system.

1997: Kyoto protocol
- high income emission: below 1990 fro 2008-2012
- international cap-and-trade system

US out : mostly because india and china not subjected 

emissions grew faster in non-participating countries

was aiming two cover 2/3 of global emissions but ended up covering 1/3 only

Paris 2015: target 2% above preindustrial levels

China announced target: 
- reduce *intensity* until 2030
Us: 26-28 by 2025
Biden: cute emissions 50% below 2005 levels by 2030


## Results

Global carbon itensity as declined at 1.6% per year ... since the 60s...

Higher rate since 90s... mostly from China

Commitements are very modest

## Climate Clubs


membership: implement global price of carbon
penalise free riding
