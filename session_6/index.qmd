# Global Warming and the Carbon Budget

## Global Warming

![Temperature Projection (ICCP)](assets/temperature_projection.jpg){width=60%}

Temperature is measured as difference to preindustrial level.

No action scenario: >+4 compared to preindustrial levels

## Global Warming

How much is too much?

![Past temperatures (from CO2 trapped in ice cores)](assets/global_temperatures_past.png)

. . .

- 4 was *glaciation*. What about >+4?
 
## Global Warming


![Risk Assessment (ICCP 2022)](assets/iccp_risk.png)


## Main Cause of Global Warming


___Consensus from Earth Science___

- burning of fossil fuels (oil, gas, ) 
    ->  emission Carbon Dioxyde CO2
    - of the main Greenhouse gases
- GHG accumulate in the atomosphere
- warms land and oceans
- more evapuration -> feedback effects


## Carbon Budget

![Global Temperature and Carbon Dioxide
 (from [globalchange.gov](https://www.globalchange.gov/browse/multimedia/global-temperature-and-carbon-dioxide))](assets/global_temperature_vs_concentration.png)

There is an approximatively linear relationship between:

- cumulative emissions of CO₂ in the atmosphere
- global temperature (with some lag)

Immediate conclusion:

- over the long-run, the world needs to target zero-emission

## Climate Clock


We can associate a maximum amount of cumulative emissions to each maximum change in temperature.

This is the global carbon budget[^source_budget]:

| $\Delta T$ | Global Carbon Budget |
|------------|----------------------|
|  1.5       |  420 Gt              |
|  2         |  1170 Gt             |

In 2018, emissions amounted to 42.1Gt.

At this rate we have [<10 years left!]{.fragment}

. . .

We should aim to reach carbon neutrality by 2030.

[^source_budget]: from IPCC 2018.TODO: update figures


## What are the options? {auto-animate="true"}

![Yoichi Kaya](assets/yoichi.jpg)

The Kaya identity:

$$F = P \frac{G}{P} \frac{E}{G} \frac{F}{E}$$

- F: global CO₂ emissions
- P: global population
- G: world GDP
- E: global energy consumption


## What are the options? {auto-animate="true"}

The Kaya identity:

$$F = P \frac{G}{P} \frac{E}{G} \frac{F}{E}$$

- $\frac{G}{P}$: GDP per capita
- $\frac{E}{G}$: energy intensity of GDP
- $\frac{F}{E}$: emission intensity of energy


## What are the options? {auto-animate="true"}

The Kaya identity works in logs:

$$\Delta^{\%} F =\Delta^{\%} P + \Delta^{\%} \left( \frac{G}{P}\right) + \Delta^{\%}\left(\frac{E}{G}\right) + \Delta^{\%}\left(\frac{F}{E}\right)$$

- $\frac{G}{P}$: GDP per capita
- $\frac{E}{G}$: energy intensity of GDP
- $\frac{F}{E}$: emission intensity of energy

## The source of actions

Who must take the decision?

- the state
    - ex: by 2035, all new cars sold in EU will be carbon neutral
    - ex: french state will construct new nuclear power plants
- the society
    - ex: social norms could deconsider meat-eating
    - ex: we stop taking the plane (our cars) to go on holidays
- the market
    - consumption and production are private decisions consistent with market equilibrium

We focus today on market-based solutions

# The Price of Carbon

## A global public bad

A stable global climate is a global public good

Carbon emissions can be thought of as a __global public *bad*__:

- non-excludable: not possible to exclude a country from its effects
- non-rivalrous:  once emitted everybody bears its consequences

Yet another definition:

- the 420Gt stock of carbon emissions is a common good.
- ... subject to the *tragedy of commons*

## The core incentive issue

Externality and free-riding

- all agents (producers/consumers) benefit from stable climate
- all agents don't receive any *marginal* benefit when emitting less CO₂
- ->Generalized temptation to free ride

The problem exists at all scales:

- all countries benefit from policies against global warming
- no country has a personal interest in implementing (costly) abattement policies




##  Externalities

::: {.callout-warning}

### Externality

An externality is an indirect cost or benefit to an uninvolved third party that arises as an effect of another party's activity.

:::

When agents (firms, consumers) maximize their objective they ignore the negative effect.

. . .

Examples:

- smoking in public
- a firm training workers
- laptops in class

If their objective is modified such as to account for the negative effects, we say that the objective has been __internalized__.

How can you make the authors of the above externalities internalize them?


## Externality and prices

In the context of market interactions, externalities imply that prices of goods don't reflect their true cost.

This leads to the notion of Pigouvian Taxation: 

- if the price of a good is incorrect it must be modified...
- ... with a tax meant to incorporate its true social cost


Theoretically, it can be shown (under very mild assumptions) that there exists an optimal Pigou tax.

## The Carbon Tax

In principle, a carbon tax is the first best solution

- it gives a price to a good (carbon emission) which is overconsumed
- this provides all the right[^theright] incentives for producers and consumers...
- ... to reduce carbon production in the most efficient way
- ... to change consumption in a way that favours less carbon production

It is also easy to implement:

- just tax the *production* of energy instead of all steps of the production process

[^theright]: nondistortive incentives

## Problems of the Carbon Tax

There are other market imperfections which the carbon tax doesn't solve

- R&D:
    - is it fostering R&D in clean technology or just reducing consumption?
- Rebound effect
    - money saved by energy efficiency can be spend on more consumption
- Leakages:
    - it can lead to more *imports* of carbon-intensive goods
    - it must be complemented by a border carbon tax

. . .

But most importantly:

- public opinion is very averse to it.

## The french experiment

A carbon tax was introduced in 2015: the "Climate-Energy Contribution"

- a tax on CO₂ content of energies
- initially very low rate
- increased over time to $44.6E/ T CO₂$

. . .

![Yellow vests](assets/yellow_vests.jpg){width=40%}

=> The yellow vests movement forced the government to back down.

## The french experiment (2)

Citizen's convention for the climate: try to build consensus

- Ocober 2019: 150 citizens drawn at random
- Mandate: define series of measures to achieve 40% reduction in GHG by 2030
- 7 sessions of 3 days

. . .

Results:

- everything *except* carbon tax!!
- price incentives: VAT reduction on train tickets
- regulatory constraints: ban polluting vehicles, mandatory house renovation, on peri-urban shoping areas
- public green investment: train, housing, infrastructure

## Point of view from most economists

Doesn't matter with which policy, a __price__ must be put on carbon emissions:

It is the only way to

- leave the market efficiently reallocate efforts across sectors
- encourage good investments over time

There is a wide consensus among economists (from Nordhaus, Stern, Aglietta...)

## Tote Bags vs Plastic Bags

::: {#fig-elephants layout-ncol=2}

![A super nice plastic bag](assets/plasticbag.png){#fig-plastic}

![A dark and boring cotton tote bag](assets/totebag.jpg){#fig-tote}

Which one do you use?
:::

. . .

Let's compare CO2 content:

- tote bag: 270Kg of CO2e
    - mostly production of cotton
- one-use plastic bag: 1.36Kg of CO2e

That means that you would need to use the tote bag 172 times for it to be less carbon intensive


## More dilemmas

Should you:

- plant grass or vegetables in you garden
- take shower or bath
- use liquid or solid soap
- ...

How can you know ? Other examples at [co2everything](https://www.co2everything.com/)

. . .

It is much easier if information is incorporated in the price.

## Price signal


We need a price signal

- for production
- for consumption
- for investment

__Market__ failure:

- markets don't determine the right price for CO2 emission.
- because of the common bad tragedy

. . .

The government(s) could intervene to set the price

. . .

But which price should be fixed?

# Estimating the price of carbon

## Integrated Assessment Models

Nordhaus was rewarded for his work on the DICE model

- DICE: Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy
- several variants

. . .

Cost-Benefit Analysis

- cost: reduced economic activity
- benefit: damage avoided

. . .

Result is a so-called Integrated Assessment Model

- it is multidisciplinary in essence
- economic models can be reused for the modelisation of costs
- results from earth scientists are incorporated to measure damage


## Damages

Damage function $D(T)$ is estimated with engineers/earth scientists

It evaluates the effect of global warming on many systems:

- natural quantitites
    - ex: water temperature, probability of storms...
- production functions
    - ex: crops become less productive

. . .

It differentiates two states for a given system

- __managed__
    ex: a dam on a river, air conditioning, the job market in the US
- __unmanaged__
    ex: a flood, storm, emergency migrations

*Tipping points* -> sudden/irreversible damage

- makes systems effectively unmanageable

## The Damage Functions


::: columns

:::: column

Results from damage estimation exercises:

- impacts are nonlinear and cumulative
- early studies:  1 or 2 degrees innocuous
- more recent ones: (ex 2018 IPCC report on 1.5)
    - even 2 degrees highly disruptive

In the DICE model damages are market and non-market

- converted in consumption equivalent
- 2% of __permanent consumption__ at 3 degrees
- 8% at 6

## The DICE Model

From Nordhaus Nobel lecture:

$$\max_{c_t} W = \max _{c_t} \int_0^{\infty} U[c(t)] e^{-\rho t} dt$$
s.t.
$$c(t) = M(y(t), z(t); α, ε(t))$$

- maximize welfare made of 
    - utility $U()$ of world consumption $c(t)$ overtime 
    - with a time discount $\rho$
- subject to many complicated constraints
    - about 20 independent equations
- this is known as a __Ramsey problem__, a variant of neoclassical growth problem
    - there is a social planner maximizing welfare
    - not the same as "planification": planner takes into account reaction of free markets

## IAM: theoretical finding

The problem just described produces two kinds of outputs:

- the optimal path for policies (for instance carbon taxes)
- the __social price of carbon__

The social price of carbon is the shadow price (or lagrange multiplier) associated to the carbon budget constraint:

- by how much welfare would be increased if the carbon budget was slightly higher
- it is the value of leaving carbon in the ground [^tobin] 
- or the price that should be given as a compensation to a firm for *not* using carbon


[^tobin]: it is similar to Tobin's q.

## Results from the actual 2018 model

Three scenarios

- Business as usual (minimal policies)
- Cost-benefit optimum (two damage functions)
- Limit temperature increase (to 1½ , 2, 2½ °C)
with hard cap
- Limit temperature increase (to 1½ , 2, 2½ °C)
over 100-year or 200-year averaging period

## Main Results

- compare with baby-model
    - DICE: 1.5 infeasible

- result of cost-benefit: 3 degrees in 2100

- slow emissions as soon as possible
- uniformity of prices
  - equalize marginal cost of reducing emissions everywhere
  - carbon price should be equal everywhere
- social cost of carbon rising over time
- policy ramp up over time
<!-- - participation must be  -->


## Controversies around the DICE model

- discount factor
    - in the formula $\max _{c_t} \int_0^{\infty} U[c(t)] e^{-\rho t} dt$ there is discount factor $\rho>0$ for future generations.
    - this discount is priced by the market and probably reflects our current preferences
    - but is it ethical to discount the future when trying to save the planet?
    - other economists (famously Nick Stern) have advocated using discount factor close to 0
- it monetizes all activities
    - can you value lost island, house damaged by hurricane
    - traditional answer: we need a metric to do cost-benefit analysis
- damage function does not correctly account for tail events (cf Weitzman)

## Social cost of carbon

Despite raising some legitimate doubts about optimal carbon policy IAM models yield estimates for the price of carbon which are used as a basis for policy discussions.

![](assets/social_cost_of_carbon.png)


<!-- Keynes: better to be vaguely right than precisely wrong -->

# Available policies

## How to raise carbon prices

Disagreement is about the *kind* of policy to raise carbon prices

Two options:

- cap maximum emissions globally and trade
    - emission rights can be exchanged so that in equilibrium the marginal cost of carbon is equalized everywhere
    - provides an incentive to reduce carbon emission efficiently
- levy tax on carbon

## Cap and Trade

A successful example:

- goal: reduce sulphur dioxyd emissions by half compared to 1980 levels 
- government  monitored emissions by 110 powerplants
- allowances were distributed to emit one ton of sulfur dioxide
- trading allowances was permitted:
- number of allowances were reduced over time

    - meet every year to report on progress (COP.x)

::::
:::: {.fragment  .current-visible}


- 1997: Kyoto protocol
    - limit emissions from high income countries: below 1990 levels fro 2008-2012
    - international cap-and-trade system
    - US out: officially because india and china not subjected 
    - protocol was aiming two cover 2/3 of global emissions but ended up covering 1/3 only
    - emissions grew faster in non-participating countries

::::
:::: {.fragment .current-visible}

- 2015: Paris Accord
    - 194 states, totalling over 98% of anthropogenic emissions
        - US out in 2020, back in 2021
    - target 2% above preindustrial levels, preferable 1.5
    - voluntary reduction targets
    - Examples:
        - China announced target: reduce carbon *intensity* by 60% until 2030
        - US: cut emissions  50% below 2005 levels by 2030

The magnitude of the commitments are similar to historical trend

- way too modest!

## Climate Clubs

The fundamental problem is that of a typical public good (bad)

- incentives to freeride...
- but without a policy-maker on top of the states

How to create a political coalition of states for climate?

- this is political economy territory

A possible solution suggested by Nordhaus

- create a climate club
- without a membership fee but with a penalty for those not belonging to it
    - for instance a uniform import tax on all non-member countries

To belong to the club:

- commit to set domestically the carbon price at an agreed amount, through any available policy (carbon tax, emission systems, regulations)

# Conclusions

##  More Integrated Assessment Models

Nowadays, the IAM approach is followed with a variety of models

In the  DICE model, the macro part is an extension of the neoclassical growth theory

- productivity growth is taken as exogenous

There are several variants:

- endogenous growth[^romer]
- endogenous participation / coalition building

[^romer]: Paul Romer obtained the Nobel price on the same year as William Nordhaus for his contributions on growth theory.

##  Green macro models

As the decision horizon is getting closer several models from traditional modeling and get their climate extension

- Computational General Equilibrium (CGE) models
    - many sectors
    - used to inform trade policy and calibrate subsidies
    - ex: [rhomolo](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2020-05/jrc113322.pdf) from European Commision

- DSGE models
    - nominal rigidities → tradeoff with on inflation/unemployment
        - ex: [IMF's GMMET model]() = GIMF + Climate
    - overlapping generations → study intergenerational equity and long term interest rate

## Basic macro tradeoff

- increasing carbon price acts like a cost-push shock (similar to rise in oil price)
- but the state perceives a revenue, which can be used to reduce costs...
    - double dividend: damage reduction, costs reduction
- ... by funding green investments (renewable energies, housing renovation, carbon sinks)
- which creates a positive demand shock
- What is the ultimate effect?
    - depends on the multiplier effect on green investment

In all cases, it is __inflationary__


## Example from GMMET

![assets/weo-ch3-chart-2.png](assets/weo-ch3-chart-2.png)

Overall, all models share the basic non-controversial conclusions as the nordhaus model

- early action
- focus on the carbon price

## Conclusion

Integrated Assessment Models are no perfect by any means

Yet:

- they provide a clean conceptual framework
- natural, actionable, policy recommendations
- and a measure of carbon price which is increasingly used in negotiations
