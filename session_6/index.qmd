# Global Warming and the Carbon Budget

## Global Warming

1. project temperature
2. historical episodes
3. ICC risk assessment

![](assets/global_temperatures_past.png)



## Main Cause of Global Warming


Consensus from Earth Science

- burning of fossil fuels (oil, gas, ) ->  Carbon Dioxyde -
- GHG accumulate in the atomosphere
- warms land and oceans
- feedback effects


##

![Global Temperature and Carbon Dioxide
 (from [globalchange.gov](https://www.globalchange.gov/browse/multimedia/global-temperature-and-carbon-dioxide))](assets/global_temperature_vs_concentration.png)

There is an approximatively linear relationship between:

- cumulative emissions of CO₂ in the atmosphere
- global temperature (with some lag)

Immediate conclusion:

- over the long-run, the world needs to target zero-emission

## Climate Clock


We can associate a maximum amount of cumulative emissions to each maximum change in temperature.

This is the global carbon budget[^source_budget]:

| $\Delta T$ | Global Carbon Budget |
|------------|----------------------|
|  1.5       |  420 Gt              |
|  2         |  1170 Gt             |

In 2018, emissions amounted to 42.1Gt.

At this rate we have [<10 years left!]{.fragment}

. . .

We should aim to reach carbon neutrality by 2030.

[^source_budget]: from IPCC 2018.TODO: update figures


## What are the options? {auto-animate="true"}

The Kaya identity:

$$F = P \frac{G}{P} \frac{E}{G} \frac{F}{E}$$

- F: global CO₂ emissions
- P: global population
- G: world GDP
- E: global energy consumption

Yoichi Kaya.


## What are the options? {auto-animate="true"}

The Kaya identity:

$$F = P \frac{G}{P} \frac{E}{G} \frac{F}{E}$$

- $\frac{G}{P}$: GDP per capita
- $\frac{E}{G}$: energy intensity of GDP
- $\frac{F}{E}$: emission intensity of energy

Yoichi Kaya.

## What are the options? {auto-animate="true"}

The Kaya identity works in logs:

$$\Delta^{\%} F =\Delta^{\%} P + \Delta^{\%} \left( \frac{G}{P}\right) + \Delta^{\%}\left(\frac{E}{G}\right) + \Delta^{\%}\left(\frac{F}{E}\right)$$

- $\frac{G}{P}$: GDP per capita
- $\frac{E}{G}$: energy intensity of GDP
- $\frac{F}{E}$: emission intensity of energy

    - a solution for developing countries
    - delicate issue... (beyond access to contraceptives)
- reduce production (growth)
    - arguable for developed countries
    - quite unpopular so far
    - possible if GDP is replaced by another welfare metric
- reduce energy intensity
    - change production to use less energy
    - new supply chains (circular economy, recycling)
    - change consumption patterns
- reduce carbon content of energy
:::


## 

TODO

Explain that energy intensity and decarbonization can be incentivized
using market mechanisms.


## Decarbonization

Main ideas:

- fuel is not rare
- problem: some will remain in the ground -> stranded asset

Gas pollutes less than coal / oil

Renewable Energies are 

- now cost-effective
- but intermittent

Need a storage technology and/or a controllable technology

Nuclear Energy


## The source of actions

Where does the decision comes from?

- the state
    - ex: by 2035, all new cars soldin EU will be carbon neutral
    - ex: french state will construct new nuclear power plants
- the society
    - ex: social norms could deconsider meat-eating
    - ex: we stop taking the plane (our cars) to go on holidays
- the market

We focus today on market-based solutions



# The Price of Carbon


## A global public bad

Carbon emissions can be thought of as a global public *bad*:

- non-excludable: not possible to exclude a country from its effects
- non-rivalrous:  once emitted everybody bears its consequences

Alternatively a stable global climate is a global public good

By contrast: the 420Gt stock of carbon emissions is a common good.

## The core incentive issue

Externality and free-riding

- all agents (producers/consumers) benefit from stable climate
- all agents don't receive any *marginal* benefit when emitting less CO₂
- ->Generalized temptation to free ride

The problem exists at all scales:

- all countries benefit from policies against global warming
- no country has a personal interest in implementing (costly) abattement policies




##  Externalities

::: {.callout-warning}

### Externality

An externality is an indirect cost or benefit to an uninvolved third party that arises as an effect of another party's activity.

:::

When agents (firms, consumers) maximize their objective they ignore the negative effect.

Examples:

- a
- b
- c

If their objective is modified such as to account for the negative effects, we say that they are __internalized__.

How can you make the authors of the above externalities internalize them?


## Externality and prices

In the context of market interactions, externalities imply that prices of goods don't reflect their true cost.

Intuition of Pigouvian Taxation: 

- if the price of a good is incorrect it must be modified...
- ... with a tax meant to incorporate its true social cost

The original motivation was to limit industrial pollution near London.

Theoretically, it can be shown (under very mild assumptions) that there exists an optimal Pigou tax.

TODO: retell that as a story

## The Carbon Tax

In principle, a carbon tax is the best solution

- it gives a price to a good (carbon emission) which is overconsumed
- this provides all the right[^theright] incentives for producers and consumers...
- ... to reduce carbon production in the most efficient way
- ... to change consumption in a way that favours less carbon production

It is also easy to implement: just tax the *production* of energy instead of all transations.

[^theright]: nondistortive incentives

## Problems of the Carbon Tax

There are other market imperfections to take into account:

- R&D: is carbon tax fostering R&D in clean technology or just reducing consumption
- kjh

....

But most importantly: public opinion is very averse to it.

## The french experiment

A carbon tax was introduced in 2015: the "Climate-Energy Contribution"

- a tax on CO₂ content of energies
- initially very low rate
- increased over time to $44.6E/ T CO₂$

=> The yellow vests movement

## The french experiment (2)

Citizen's convention for the climate:

- Ocober 2019: 150 citizens drawn at random
- Mandate: define series of measures to achieve 40% reduction in GHG by 2030
- 7 sessions of 3 days

. . .

Results:

- everything *except* carbon tax!!
- price incentives
- regulatory constraints

## Economists

Doesn't matter with which policy, a __price__ must be put on carbon emissions:

It is the only way to

- leave the market efficiently reallocate efforts across sectors
- encourage good investments over time

There is a wide consensus among economists (from Nordhaus, Stern, Aglietta...)

## Tote Bags vs Plastic Bags

::: {#fig-elephants layout-ncol=2}

![A super nice plastic bag](assets/plasticbag.png){#fig-plastic}

![A dark and boring cotton tote bag](assets/totebag.jpg){#fig-tote}

Which one do you use?
:::

. . .

Let's compare CO2 content:

- tote bag: 270Kg of CO2e
    - mostly production of cotton
- one-use plastic bag: 1.36Kg of CO2e

That means that you would need to use the tote bag 172 times for it to be less carbon intensive


## More dilemmas

Should you:

- plant grass or vegetables in you garden
- take shower or bath
- use liquid or solid soap
- ...

How can you know ?

. . .

It is much easier if information is incorporated in the price.

More on it at https://www.co2everything.com/


## Price is a signal

for production
for consumption


## Small parenthesis about the soviet union


## Problem

Market failure: markets don't determine the right price for CO2 emission.

Policies are needed.

But which price should be fixed?

# Estimating the price of carbon

## Where does the price of carbon comes from

The Social Price of Carbon was initially computed as a byproduct of a cost-benefit analysis of decarbonization.

- cost: reduced economic activity
- benefit: damage avoided

The result is a so-called Integrated Assessment Model

Economic models can be reused for the modelisation of costs

Results from earth scientists are incorporated to measure damage


## Damages

damages to different sectors:

- managed
- unmanaged
(provide examples: high income, low income)

tipping points: -> sudden/irreversible damage

- makes systems effectively unmanageable

impacts: nonlinear and cumulative

early studies:  1 or 2 degrees innocuous

mor recent ones: (ex 2018 IPCC report on 1.5) even 2 degrees highly disruptive

## 

DICE: damages are market and non-market

- 2% at 3 degrees of permanent consumption
- 8% at 6

Howard and Sterner: even more *3.5 times higher

damages:

- include catastrophic events
- do not allow for fat tails (contentious)


- can you value lost island, house damaged by hurricane
- traditional answer: we need a metric

Keynes: better to be vaguely right than precisely wrong


## What does it look like?

From Nordhaus Nobel lecture:

$$\max_{c_t} W = \max _{c_t} \int_0^{\infty} U[c(t)] e^{-\rho t} dt$$
s.t.
$$c(t) = M(y(t), z(t); α, ε(t))$$

- maximize welfare made of 
    - utility $U()$ of world consumption $c(t)$ overtime 
    - with a time discount $\rho$
- subject to many complicated constraints
    - about 20 independent equations
- this is known as a Ramsey problem:
    - not the same as "planification": planner takes into account reaction of free markets

## IAM: theoretical finding

social cost of carbon

the shadow price of optimization
what would be the benefit of relaxing the constraint by a little amount ?

## Concretely

[DICE 2016 in GAMS](https://github.com/olugovoy/climatedice/blob/master/GAMS/DICE2016/DICE2016R-091916ap.gms)

Look at the endogenous variables and exogenous parameters

- description of the economy is very crude

We can play with an interactive version based on [DICE 2010](http://webdice.rdcep.org/)

## Results from the 2018 model

Three scenarios

- Business as usual (minimal policies)
- Cost-benefit optimum (two damage functions)
- Limit temperature increase (to 1½ , 2, 2½ °C)
with hard cap
- Limit temperature increase (to 1½ , 2, 2½ °C)
over 100-year or 200-year averaging period

![](assets/abatement_vs_damages.png)

## Main Results

- compare with baby-model
    - DICE: 135 infeasible
    - cost-benefit: 3 degrees in 2100

- slow emissions as soon as possible
- uniformity of prices
  - equalize marginal cost of reducing emissions everywhere
  - carbon price should be equal everywhere
- high participation
- social Cost of carbon rising over time
- policy ramp up over time


## Controversies around the DICE model

- discount factor
    - in the formula $\max _{c_t} \int_0^{\infty} U[c(t)] e^{-\rho t} dt$ there is discount factor $\rho>0$ for future generations.
    - this discount is priced by the market and probably reflects our current preferences
    - but is it ethical to discount the future when trying to save the planet?
    - other economists (famously Nick Stern) have advocated using discount factor close to 0
- it monetizes all activities
    - can you value lost island, house damaged by hurricane
    - traditional answer: we need a metric to do cost-benefit analysis
- damage function does not correctly account for tail events

## Social cost of carbon

Despite raising some legitimate doubts about optimal carbon policy IAM models yield estimates for the price of carbon which are used as a basis for policy discussions.

# Available policies

## How to raise carbon prices

Disagreement is about the *kind* of policy to raise carbon prices

Two options:

- cap maximum emissions globally and trade
    - emission rights can be exchanged so that in equilibrium the marginal cost of carbon is equalized everywhere
    - provides an incentive to reduce carbon emission efficiently
- levy tax on carbon

## Cap and Trade

A successful example:

- goal: reduce sulphur dioxyd emissions by half compared to 1980 levels 
- government  monitored emissions by 110 powerplants
- allowances were distributed to emit one ton of sulfur dioxide
- trading allowances was permitted:
- number of allowances were reduced over time

## CLimate agreements

- 1994: United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change

    - goal:  achieve stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interferences with the climate system.
    - meet every year to report on progress (COP.x)

- 1997: Kyoto protocol
    - limit emissions from high income countries: below 1990 levels fro 2008-2012
    - international cap-and-trade system
    - US out: officially because india and china not subjected 
    - protocol was aiming two cover 2/3 of global emissions but ended up covering 1/3 only
    - emissions grew faster in non-participating countries

- 2015: Paris Accord
    - 194 states, totalling over 98% of anthropogenic emissions
        - US out in 2020, back in 2021
    - target 2% above preindustrial levels, preferable 1.5
    - voluntary reduction targets
    - Examples:
        - China announced target: reduce carbon *intensity* by 60% until 2030
        - US: cut emissions  50% below 2005 levels by 2030

The magnitude of the commitments are similar to historical trend

- way too modest!

## Climate Clubs

The fundamental problem is that of a typical public good (bad)

- incentives to freeride...
- but without a policy-maker on top of the states

How to create a political coalition of states for climate?

- this is political economy territory

A possible solution advocated by Nordhaus: (TODO source)

- create a climate club
- without a membership fee but with a penalty for those not belonging to it

To belong to the club:

- commit to set domestically the carbon price at an agreed amount, through any available policy (carbon tax, emission systems, regulations)
