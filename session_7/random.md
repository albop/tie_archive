Beyond GDP:
what does GDP measure ?
production: it reflects preferences
- through prices or relative prices

Fabre and douenne

5000 economists made petition for the carbon tax in the US and Europe

France abandonned its plan.

Why?
- they disagree for lack of altruism
- they disagree with the way costs are distributed
- pessimistic beliefs about the effects of the policy
    - even for people benefiting from the tax

- carbon taxation is regressive:
  - poorer household spend on average larger share of income on polluting goods
- tax and dividend would benefit poorer people
  - majority of people better off

- Survey: 3000 respondants
  - explain policy: 50E/carbon tax
  - dividend: 0.11 euro per litre of gasoline
  - > 70% of people reject the proposal
  - even higher than pre/after yellow vests movement
    - ADEME 2020
    - volatile opinion: why?

- Figure 1:
  - totally inelastic expenditures:
    - people don't change their consumption at all!
  - actual redistribution effects (allowing for consumption reallocation)

Only 14% think they would benefit from the reform

Is it because they don't correctly anticipate how they would change their consumption?


People are also pessimistic about the effects of the reform:
- 20% believe it would benefit poorer households
- 17% think it would be effectif for reducing pollution / fighting climate change


--- Effects of beliefs

- pople discard positive news but correctly process negative ones:
  - confirmation bias !
  - or "motivated beliefs"
- if against policy or close to the yellow vest: stronger effect

- beliefs also determine support:
  - if convinced they would benefit: proba + 50%
  - if convinced it would reduce emissions: + 40%

Bonus: how to obtain causal effect?
