# What's wrong with the carbon tax?

## The carbon tax is so wonderful...

Economists have many reasons to disagree with each other. But sometimes they agree.

>  I. The review conducted by a distinguished international panel of scientists under the auspices of the International Panel on Climate Change has determined that "the balance of evidence suggests a discernable human influence on global climate." As economists, we believe that global climate change carries with it significant environmental, economic, social, and geopolitical risks, and that preventive steps are justified.

>  I I. Economic studies have found that there are many potential policies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions for which the total <mark>benefits outweigh the total costs</mark>. For the United States in particular, sound economic analysis shows that there are policy options that would slow climate change <mark>without harming American living standards</mark>, and that these measures may in fact <mark>improve U.S. productivity in the long run.</mark>

. . .

>  I I I. The most efficient approach to slowing climate change is through <mark>market-based policies</mark>. In order for the world to achieve its climatic objectives at minimum cost, a cooperative approach among nations is required – such as an international emissions trading agreement. The United States and other nations can most efficiently implement their climate policies through market mechanisms, such as <mark>carbon taxes or the auction of emissions permits</mark>. The revenues generated from such policies can effectively be used to <mark>reduce the deficit or to lower existing taxes</mark>.

# Preferences

## Reminder: The Ramsey planner

In the Integrated Assessment model optimal policies are given by a *Ramsey problem*
$$\max_{c_t} \int_{t=0}^{\infty} e^{-\rho t} U(c_t)$$ subject to
$$\begin{cases}
    \text{environemental damages} \\
    \text{market equilibrium}
\end{cases}$$

Preferences over the various scenarios are represented by:

- $\rho$: time discount (preference for the present)
- $U(c)$: utility derived by consumption

## The Stern Review

In 2006: the Stern Review

- Commissionned by chancellor of the exchequer Gordon Brown (UK)
- By a team lead by Nick Stern (LSE)
- Extensive study (700p) on the effecto of climate change on the economy

Overall the findings reinforce those from Nordhaus:

- early action is better
- climate change is a big market failure that should be corrected with environmental taxes
- there should be a carbon price
- ...

But report was more pessimistic:

- estimates the annual cost of transition to 1% of GDP
    - updated to 2% in 2008
- without action >5% of GDP

## The debate over the calibration of preferences

The Stern report and Nordhaus model use different discount factors $e^{-\rho r}$

- Nordhaus: 4.3% a year
    - a *descriptive* value, observed in the markets
- Stern: discount rate 1.4% a year
    - a *prescriptive* value, chosen by the policy maker
    - future generations should not be discounted...
    - ... or by a very small number to account for the possibility of an exogenous calamity destroying humanity

. . .

- Using maket value doesn't work if there is a market failure concerning intertemporal allocation
- One can't escape the ethical debate of choosing the right discount factor


## The debate over the calibration of preferences (2)


Then what exactly is $U(c_t)$ ?

It is utility of (global) consumption.

It doesn't integrate:

- equality concerns
- other sources of (non-market)  happiness 
    - breathing fresh air
    - having a stable temperature
- ...


## Debate

An now Nick Stern has returned with a another explosive proposition!

*For climate economics, preferences can and should be treated as endogenous* by Linus Mattauch,  Nicholas Stern,  Théo Konc

Formulate some questions

What is so new about treating preferences as endogenous?
