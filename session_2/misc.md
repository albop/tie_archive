# AI Biases vs Human Biases

Main angles:

- stupid behaviour
- scoring biases*
    - selection biases
    - learning biases
    - adaptive biases
- preference misspecification
- behavioral mistakes
    - the preferences are well specified but the algorithms don't work
- AI project (determine procedure)

Discussion about whether biases are conscious or not.

Is AI stupid?
- it is seeing the world in a different light (different coordinates) (ex. of )
- it is lacking "context", meta heuristics (or ability to disobey)


* how much of a restriction is that? Taking decisions consists in scoring several options against each other.

* Decision making:
    - objective maximization vs preferences
    - why do we always assume that robots are single objective agents?

* Is AI following its own objective or immitating humans?

Examples:

- AI bias: in health, biased towards rich customers
- Human bias:
  - dentist: towards self interest (i.e. towards treatment)
  - towards bankable clients 
  - male/female: towards self gender
    Patient–physician gender concordance and increased mortality among female heart attack patients
- Is it safe to drive an AI driven car?
  - data about accidents
  - foolish decisions?

How do we measure the bias?

Very stupid example from AI: car running in circle

Definition of decision: rather large. Contains
    - classification
    - action
Decision-making: (does it involve taking-responsibility?)

Thinking about decision:
- quantitative
- qualitative 
- theoretical (decision science)

The decision sciences concern themselves with questions like:
- “How should you set up decision criteria and design your metrics?” (All)
- “Is your chosen metric incentive-compatible?” (Economics)
- “What quality should you make this decision at and how much should you pay for perfect information?” (Decision analysis)
- “How do emotions, heuristics, and biases play into decision-making?” (Psychology)
- “How do biological factors like cortisol levels affect decision-making?” (Neuroeconomics)
- “How does changing the presentation of information influence choice behavior?” (Behavioral Economics)
- “How do you optimize your outcomes when making decisions in a group context?” (Experimental Game Theory)
- “How do you balance numerous constraints and multistage objectives in designing the decision context?” (Design)
- “Who will experience the consequences of the decision and how will various groups perceive that experience?” (UX Research)
- “Is the decision objective ethical?” (Philosophy)
