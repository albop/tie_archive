### Three hypotheses

1. Another Technological Advance
2. Another Technological Advance, Just, More Extreme
3. Something else Completely

## The Future of Work. Now.

## Conclusion

## Not fitting yet

## AI 

Makes predictions cheap.

Surprise: many problems can be formulated as prediction problems

Data-in -> Data-out ? 
 
Not quite

Is Data a fundamentally different kind of input ?
Is it a fundamentally fundamentally different kind of capital ?

Who does it belong to ? How is it paid for ?

Theory 1: marginal value of new data increases more than proportionnally. Network externalities. Very hard for new entrants. Natural monopoly.

Theory 2: cost of data processing will be so small soon, it will be easier for new entrants.


Examples: 
- GPT-3: 175 billion parameters
- 45 TB of Data
- 50 petaflop/s-days  (1000 teraflops)
  - comparison: core i7, Haswell, (340 gigaflops)
- GPT-3, requires an amount of energy equivalent to the yearly consumption of 126 Danish homes for one training session

AI advised a simulated patient to commit suicide.

## Energy consumption ?

- Current AI model (deeplearning) is based on cheap energy
    - very inefficient
    - *lots* of useless operations
- hyperparameters tuning does not 
- programming model is very energy consuming
