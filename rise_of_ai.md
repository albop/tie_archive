## General Considerations on AI

## "This Time it's Different" or "Same old, same old"

### Reminder: the Neoclassical View of Production

TODO: graph with factors and production

- production takes several factors as inputs
- marginal returns w.r.t. each factor are *decreasing*
- factors are paid according to their marginal productivity
- the precise description depends on the problem under consideration
- what would you change to take into account the effect of AI?
  - data, technological change ? 

----

### Example:

[TODO: production function with data]

Chad Jones and Christopher Tonetti (Stanford) (Sep 2020, American Economic Review)

- Data is a factor, not a technology
  - idea: use machine learnig to build self driving cars
  - data: each car-maker athering is own data
- Data improves quality of product (even if anonymous)
- A nonrival good: can be used with leftovers
  - but excludable: club goods
- Nonrival implies *increasing returns to scale*

- Consequences: who owns the data ? Consumer, producer.
  - what is the price of data, where are the markets?
  - increasing returns to scale implies monopoly
    - GAFAs
    - increasing suboptimal monopoly rents (already a problem before existence of AI...)
  - solutions:
    - split the monopolies (if deadweight loss is too big)
    - outlaw data gathering
    - force data-sharing: make it a public good
    - let the consumer be free to decide whether to rent his data

### Mr ...

[TODO: production function with prediction]

AI is a decrease in the __cost__ of predictions

Salary of all jobs complementary with predictions will rise


----

### Other view

- AI is just the latest in technological growth
  - is it labour-saving ? or labour-augmenting ?
  - depends for whom...

- AI is a new kind of capital, a substitute for humans




----


### Three hypotheses

1. Another Technological Advance
   1. data
   2. predictions
2. Another Technological Advance, Just, More Extreme
   1. a competitor for humans
3. Something else Completely

---

### Remark

From a neoclassical perspective:
- AI cuts down costs, increase production, improves revenue, improves welfare
- *only* relevant question: for whom?
  - unless *malthusian* effect kicks in

## The Future of Work. Now.

## Rise of the Robots


---

## Something Else Completely


---

## Conclusion


---

## Not fitting yet

### AI 

Makes predictions cheap.

Surprise: many problems can be formulated as prediction problems

Data-in -> Data-out ? 
 
Not quite

Is Data a fundamentally different kind of input ?
Is it a fundamentally fundamentally different kind of capital ?

Who does it belong to ? How is it paid for ?

Theory 1: marginal value of new data increases more than proportionnally. Network externalities. Very hard for new entrants. Natural monopoly.

Theory 2: cost of data processing will be so small soon, it will be easier for new entrants.


Examples: 
- GPT-3: 175 billion parameters
- 45 TB of Data
- 50 petaflop/s-days  (1000 teraflops)
  - comparison: core i7, Haswell, (340 gigaflops)
- GPT-3, requires an amount of energy equivalent to the yearly consumption of 126 Danish homes for one training session

AI advised a simulated patient to commit suicide.

### Energy consumption ?

- Current AI model (deeplearning) is based on cheap energy
    - very inefficient
    - *lots* of useless operations
- hyperparameters tuning does not 
- programming model is very energy consuming

- Example of : cost adjustment...


----

### Definitions

- AI can be:
  - a field
  - a set of technologies including
    - machine learning
    - deep learning
    - reinforcement learning
  - a philosophical concept


- Automation: control "process" without human assistance

- Artificial intelligence: usual definition
  - mimic human intelligence: problem solving, learning
  - without emotions

- Behave like a human:
  - Turing Test
  - Chinese Room Agreement
    - I am intelligent if I follow a rule book ?

- Weak AI / Strong AI
  - Weak: 
    - specific task (recognize images, interpolate data, drive car)
    - human specify objectives, training hyperparameters
  - Strong AI:
    - general-purpose
    - sets it own goal
    - over time

- Strong AI: general artificial intelligence
  - at least as strong as humans
    - turing test
    - CRA
  - would still have to learn

  <!-- - very big "Reinforcement Learning Machine" -->

- AI effect:
  - people have a way to discount achievments of AI as "not AI"
    - because not impressive enough
    - because humans do it in "a different way"
  - Larry Tesler theorem: AI is whatever hasn't been done yet
  - keep human special
    - interestingly that didn't seem to be a concern
    - recall AI history


- Don't be naive: AI might have intrinsic limits...
  - ... but we are repeatedly proven wrong
  - ... if they exist we don't know what they are


- Artificial intelligence: oxymoron ? 


## AI vs Automation

How is AI different from automation ?

- 
- AI: more general purpose technology
