## Data-based economics

- All economists use data all the time
  - to illustrate facts
  - for research purposes

- You need to know how to
  - import data, clean it
  - explore it, perform basic data description tasks
  - run regressions

## Econometricks

- An art invented by economists: $$\underbrace{y}\_{\text{dependent variable}} = a \underbrace{x}\_{\text{explanatory variable}} + b$$
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Example 1:
  - I want to establish a link between growth and trade openness
  - but my country has only 10 years of historical data... (within dimension)
  - ... let's take 50 countries at the same time (between dimension)
  - find a way to analyse both dimensions at the same time
  - -> panel data
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Example 2:
  -  young men who go to war have in average lower wages when they return
  -  ... is it because they skipped college ?
  -  ... or did they choose to go to way because they were less skilled for college ?
  -  find a way to extract *causality*
  -  -> instrumental variables

## Big Data Era and Machine Learning

- Some kinds of data has become very abundant
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->Large amounts of data of all kinds
  - structured (tables, ...)
  - unstructured (text, images, ...)
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->Machine learning approach:
  - a set of powerful algorithms...
  - ... so powerful some call it *artificial intelligence*
    - they *learn* by processing data
  - ... to extract information and relations in large data sets
  - ... 
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->Comparison with econometrics
  - ML has it own, partially redundant, jargon
  - much harder to understand causality, standard deviation (i.e. precision)

## Programming in Python

- Easy, clean, widespread programming language
  - free
  - libraries for virtually any task
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->Lingua franca of machine learning community
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->Data analysts/Statisticians/Researchers spend most of their time...
  - ... programming
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->Presentation (plots, interactive apps) is super important and relies on ...
  - ... programming
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->Worth investing a  bit of time to learn it
  - you can easily become an expert
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->Plus it's fun
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->In this course we'll be using python, mostly, as a scripting langage

## Evaluation & Final Examination

- Data Project
  - group work
  - goals:
    - import some data
    - perform/replicate some econometric work
    - present result with nice plot
  - handled as a Jupyter Notebook (mixes text and code)
  - subjects proposed by myself and other professors
- Programming test
  - small coding tasks

---

## Work Environment

- local programming environment:
  - install [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) for your computer
  - install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - make sure python extension is activated and configured in VSCode

- online environement:
  - use google' [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true)
